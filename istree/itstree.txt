design guide

first, read symbols from file, get the vector symbs,
	each symbol has its name, two vertex names, and value;
	the first two symbols in the vector symbs is sZero & sOne.
	
adjust the order of symbs, this as independent step, instead inner stree.
	
secondly, stree initialize with symbs
	and initialize the root node, with initial graph
	and initialize the two terminal stnode pZero & pOne.
	
thirdly, build in some way.
	Span, third methods, BFS, BFS layer to layer, & DFS
	Zero suppress, recursive or non-recursive
	Reduce, recursive or non-recursive
	
	some macros are needed to control these selection.
	and control print of statistics infomation, count & timing
	
then, test the result of different orders

to create graph from symbs, it need make the symb indexed. this should 
also be done independentl

finally, test k-MST method.
